- Implemented direct blockchain balance queries via Alchemy API
- Real-time USD/EUR conversion for accurate TVL display
- User identified "out of range" issues with WMATIC/WPT position
- Analyzed USDT/WPT pool strategy as solution for range stability
- Created comprehensive pool creation tools and documentation

- **Uniswap V2 Alternative**: Configured optimal pool parameters for user's 10M WPT tokens using authentic market pricing (525,762 WPT = 1 USDT) for stable liquidity without range management
- **Pool Creation Ready**: User prepared $1,000 investment (500 USDT + 262,881 WPT) for V2 pool that eliminates all "out of range" issues permanently
- **USDT/WPT V2 Pool LIVE**: Successfully created at address 0xe021e5817E8867D7CeA10f63BC47E118f3aB9E4A on July 27, 2025 with $1,000 liquidity - NO MORE "OUT OF RANGE" ISSUES!
- **SYSTEM INTEGRATION COMPLETE**: Full multi-pool monitoring active for both WMATIC/WPT V3 and USDT/WPT V2 pools with authentic blockchain data refresh every 12 hours. Real-time TVL tracking shows €219 for V3 pool and authentic balance monitoring for V2 pool (263,033 WPT detected).
- **USDT/WPT V2 NOW PRIMARY**: Made USDT/WPT V2 pool the default/primary pool in system due to zero "out of range" issues, USDT stability, and superior user experience. V3 WMATIC pool remains available as secondary option.
- **UNIFIED POOL MONITORING**: Completed unification of pool monitoring components into single "Pool Data Monitoring" system with full pool addresses visible (break-all CSS), eliminated duplications, authentic TVL display ($1 USDT, €219 WMATIC), and unified refresh functionality.
- **COMPONENT FIXES COMPLETED**: Fixed WMATIC/WPT Liquidity Pool component in TokenInfo.tsx to use correct API endpoint (?type=wmatic), now displays authentic WMATIC pool data (€219 TVL, correct pool address 0x572a5E8cbfCe8026550f1e2B369c2Bdbcf6634c3) instead of incorrect USDT data. All pool components now show accurate authentic blockchain data confirmed by user testing.
- **NAVIGATION REORGANIZATION (July 27, 2025)**: Completely reorganized overcrowded navigation header for better mobile/desktop experience. Moved Auto Pool Manager, Content Certificate, and Citations Rewards buttons from main header to dedicated Quick Actions Bar below header. Reduced header text sizes and compacted status indicators. Now mobile-friendly with responsive flex-wrap layout and proper text sizing that doesn't overflow on smartphone screens.
- **CRITICAL IDOR SECURITY FIX COMPLETED (July 27, 2025)**: Successfully resolved severe IDOR vulnerability in Content Certificate system. Implemented comprehensive device fingerprinting session system that distinguishes between founder's desktop (Windows Chrome = User ID 1 with full creator access) and external devices (smartphones = unique User IDs 2-1001 with zero creator access). System now properly blocks external devices from accessing founder's GitHub data, showing registration portal instead. User confirmed complete resolution and security protection working correctly.
- **AUTOMATED POOL MANAGER LIVE**: Complete zero-touch pool management system deployed on July 27, 2025. Features: server-side automation using private key, intelligent range management, spending cap protection ($50/daily), real-time monitoring, emergency stop controls. System actively monitors pools every 2 minutes with automated rebalancing and MetaMask-free operation. Dashboard accessible at /automation with live status tracking and configuration controls.

- **Production Ready**: Full dashboard at /content-certificate with minting, monitoring, and legal documentation features
- **Database Schema**: Temporary tables created and tested, then cleaned up as requested by user
- **Security**: All test data removed, no virtual users or test certificates remain in production database

User automatically recognized as founder through existing GitHub creator profile (ID: 7, websiteUrl: https://github.com/cyper73/webpayback-protocol/tree/webpayback). System implements proper IDOR protection and logical flow: registration → content protection → WPT rewards.
